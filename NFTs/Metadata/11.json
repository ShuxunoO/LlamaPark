    "description": "Greetings! I'm Professor Fluff, Llama Park's beloved host and silver-skinned sage. Rocking a wise grey afro and 3D glasses (for seeing all sides of an argument!), this ENFJ runs the most enlightening 'Talk Show' from his desert oasis. His joyful bleat is a warm 'Mmm-baaaah! Insightful!' If you bring negativity, he'll gently guide you to a more positive pixel with a calm, 'Now, now, let's reframe that.' He's all about connection and deep chats!"
