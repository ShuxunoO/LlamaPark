Donning Luffy’s straw hat and a red shirt, this fluffy-wooled boy llama’s shiny eyes gleam with adventure. An ISTJ with a reckless streak, he’s a Google whiz, charting new quests in a flash. “Yo-ho puff puff!” he yells, chasing thrills, but his bold moves often spark chaos with a cheeky spit. His lively heart and daring vibe make him the sea’s rowdiest captain!"
