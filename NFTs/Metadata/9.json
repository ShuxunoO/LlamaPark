    "description": "Shhh! It's Terra, the craftiest llama in the pixelated forest. With her messy green bun and squinty eyes that miss nothing, this spotted brown ISTP is a 'Google' master, always digging up secrets. She wears practical overalls for her adventures. Her happy sound is a soft 'Hmm-hmm-hmmm' of discovery. Upset her? She'll expertly camouflage and leave you talking to a pixelated bush! 'Knowledge is treasure,' she'd whisper, if she weren't so busy finding it."
