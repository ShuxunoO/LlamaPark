    "description":"Say hello to the futuristic fuzzball lighting up Llama Park! With round ear antennas twitching like radar dishes and gadget scanner eyes that glint with futuristic flair, this blue-skinned wonder zips through Future Tokyo in a flash of 22nd-century style. Donning a pocket-packed outfit and rocking a 4D Pocket just like a certain robotic cat we know, they're your go-to buddy for pulling out wild inventions at just the right moment. An ENFJ at heart, they radiate warmth, rally the herd with a spark of charisma, and somehow always know exactly what you need. “Need a time-traveling umbrella or snack machine? Got it!” This llama’s got heart, tech, and charm—all wrapped up in one hyper-evolved hug of a hero."
